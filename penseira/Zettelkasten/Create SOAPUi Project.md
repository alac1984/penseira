1. CTRL + N for New Project
2. In Project Name, create a project name
3. In Initial WSDL, type the endpoint for the WSDL file
4. After hit ok, navigator bar will shown all possible endpoints for this SOAP API.

## Improvement Notes:

I don't get completely the concept of a SOAP API. My guess is the WSDL file is a XML file that works like a index page. It probably gives all these code snippets to the various endpoints in that particular API, but I'm not sure enough.
