1. Go to Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Choose the appropriate Python version and download it for Windows (.msi)
3. Follow the steps, choosing the options to add Python to PATH. *Note: in my experience, it doesn't work sometimes* 
4. Open Powershell and type `python`
5. If Python doesn't open with 4, add Python to path as in [[Adding Python and its libraries to PATH on Windows]]
