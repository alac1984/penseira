**Supervised learning**: the data provided for the machine learning model is labeled. The model will read all labeled input and try to predict the labels from new provided input. As an example, imagine we give a million labeled pictures of cats, dogs and lizards to a model. After it read all of them we can provide new pics and the model will try to guess if it is a dog, cat or lizard.

**Unsupervised learning**: data here is unlabeled, and the model will discover patterns in this data. As an example, we give a million unlabeled pictures of cats, dogs and lizards, and the model will cluster them by their similarities.

**Reinforcement learning**: the model learns based on rewards and penalties. As an example, remember the model trained to play Street Fighter II.
