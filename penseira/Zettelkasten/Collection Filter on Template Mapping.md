3. In the gear icon on the top left, choose the option Collection Filter and drag it to the table's area
4. In the Filter table, connect the "out" node with the output tag defined in the Document Template (i.e. the tag you described in template's for loop)
5. Connect the other node (the "in" node with the collection you want to filter in your data model)
6. If the Select a Filter window does not appear when you do #5, double click on the "in" node to expand this window
