To install `scoop`, simply execute this command on Powershell:

```powershell
iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
```

In the reference website there are some tips and tricks to avoid errors, but the first time I've installed it on Windows 10, I did not need to do anything like that. The above command were sufficient.
