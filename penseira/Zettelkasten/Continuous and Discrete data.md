Discrete data: countable, limited. Ex.: the number of oranges on a box, number of students who attended a class, the number of ambulances in a city.

Continuous Data: it's about accuracy. It's the opposite of discrete data, despite being both numerical. They come from measurement. Ex.: the weather temperature, wind speed, or the weight of kids.
